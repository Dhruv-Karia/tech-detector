We learned the different data types, for and while loops, if statements, and different built-in functions. We focused a lot on dictionaries as a way to prepare for the next stage of learning(with Pandas and dataframes)</span></div><div class="v17_476"><div class="v17_477"></div><span class="v17_479">Picking a Project</span><span class="v17_485">Probably the longest, most difficult part of the AI building project was trying to agree on what topic to do. Honestly, it took way too long. 

We ended up doing a ranking system where we listed our favorite and least favorite ideas and picked the one with the highest total points as our project idea.</span></div><div class="v17_486"><div class="v17_487"></div><span class="v17_489">Labeling Images</span><span class="v17_495">In this phase, we had to get a large sample size of items that <em></em>we were going to try to detect and then label them with boxes so that we could use them to train the AI.

In this stage, we searched the web using a process called web scraping to get over 6000 total images to traing our AI. After this, we also had to label those images to make sure that the AI could try to find the best weights.</span></div><div class="v24_8"><div class="v24_9"></div><span class="v24_11">Learning Pandas</span><span class="v24_12">Pandas is a library in python that is used to process data in the field of data science. We learned to use dataframes and manipulate the data inside them. We learned to sort using a column(s), add new data based on other columns, and use attributes of the dataframe to solve problems.</span></div><div class="v24_13"><div class="v24_14"></div><span class="v24_16">Training the AI</span><span class="v24_17">To train the AI, we used the camp’s GPU servers overnight for about 15 hours, We had to create code to seperate the different stages of training. We used 80% of the images to do the actual training, 10% to do the validating, and the last 10% to do the evaluating.</span></div><div class="v24_18"><div class="v24_19"></div><span class="v24_21">Evaluating the AI</span><span class="v24_22">Obviously, we can’t just have the AI do its thing without checking how good it is at doing it. In this step of the proces, we worked with confusion matrices to see just how often the AI was able to detect the right piece of tech and how often it didn’t. </span></div>
